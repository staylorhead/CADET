# CADET: Enhanced transcriptome-wide association analyses in admixed samples using eQTL summary data 

## Introduction

CADET is a tool that enables powerful transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of admixed cohorts leveraging the local-ancestry (LA) information of the cohort along with summary-level eQTL data from reference panels of different ancestral groups. CADET combines multiple polygenic risk score models with the summary-level eQTL reference data to predict LA-aware genetically-regulated gene expression in admixed test samples. This gene expression can then be used in TWAS to test for gene-level association with a given phenotype.

## Installation 

CADET depends on [OTTERS](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36862-w). Please follow the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/daiqile96/OTTERS) and create the OTTERS environment.
